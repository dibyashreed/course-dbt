### Week 2 Project

#### What is our user repeat rate? Repeat Rate = Users who purchased 2 or more times / users who purchased

#### What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again? What about indicators of users who are likely NOT to purchase again? If you had more data, what features would you want to look into to answer this question?

#### Explain the product mart models you added. Why did you organize the models in the way you did?
